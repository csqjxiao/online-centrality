=================

This repository contains the code used in the Online Centrality research of Ferenc Béres, [Róbert Pálovics](https://github.com/rpalovics) and András A. Benczúr at [SZTAKI DMS](https://dms.sztaki.hu/en).

# Introduction

Online Centrality is a centrality measure updateable by the
edge stream in a dynamic network. It incorporates the elapsed time of edge activations as time decay.
